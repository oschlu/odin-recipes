    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package medium-wide egg noodles</li>
        <li>1 cup butter, divided</li>
        <li>2 large onions, chopped</li>
        <li>2 small heads cabbage, cored and cut into 1-inch pieces</li>

        <li> Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). </li>

        <li> Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in egg noodles and return to a boil. Cook noodles uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender but slightly firm, about 5 minutes. Drain well and set aside. </li>

        <li> Add cabbage and remaining 1/2 cup butter to onions; cook and stir until cabbage is softened but not browned, 5 to 8 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper. </li>

        <li> Place cooked noodles and cabbage mixture in a large roasting pan; stir gently to combine. Sprinkle with more salt and black pepper, if desired. </li>

        <li> Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown on top, 30 to 40 minutes. </li>
    </ol>
